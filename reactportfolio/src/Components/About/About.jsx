                My name is Joe Shields Iâ€™m a Software 
                Developer from the northern suburbs of Chicago. 
                I enjoy front-end design, creating three.js 3D elements
                but I'm focused on my back-end skills and have 
                recently started learning React. I have a diverse background 
                and recently received a cerificate in Full Stack Development
